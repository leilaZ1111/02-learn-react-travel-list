This Travel List App is a dynamic and interactive web application built using React that allows users to create and manage their packing lists for trips.

The project demonstrates proficiency in React components and the effective management of states and props through React's hooks and lifting up state techniques. It showcases essential React concepts such as component composition, state management, and conditional rendering.

The project is part of the online course ["The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux, & More"](https://www.udemy.com/share/108PTK3@svd7LSKS9ey6F-mAoiPwPf0maT7NoRyTUO4HqpNWgU6hsdF-ESPRYJMbg9njS0DY-g==/) by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. It serves as a practical application of the concepts and skills taught in the course, making it an excellent resource for React enthusiasts looking to learn by example.
